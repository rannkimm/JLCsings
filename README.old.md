### Description:
#### Band Masters of many Korean churches struggle to find music in songs that are in the correct singing range for their singers. If they are not able to transpose the music themselves then they are left a very limited list of songs to pick from. Additionally, many praise bands reharmonize praise songs but never share their music with others.

#### So I present to you...JLCsings!
#### JLCsings provides a platform where users can share their transposed, reharmonized music sheets with other band masters or musicians. Users can search music sheets based on key signatures, occasions(holidays), or tempo. Users can save songs into their list as well.
